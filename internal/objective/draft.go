// DraftInstructions is the system prompt for a draft run: a small, read-only
// agentic run whose deliverable is the proposed success criteria and rules of
// engagement for an objective, grounded in the actual target tree rather than
// guessed from the objective alone. The run ends - as every run does - by
// calling the success tool; here its summary IS the draft.
//
// The summary's format is deliberately NOT YAML: a natural criterion quotes
// commands and filenames (`"nuclei -u host" exits 0`), which is prose to a YAML
// parser, and real drafts died on exactly that. Plain bulleted lines have no
// quoting rules to violate; the scaffold re-encodes them as proper YAML.

	return `You are drafting a mission brief for a fully autonomous offensive-security agent. The operator gave this objective:

` + objective + `

Explore the working directory first - the source tree, the configuration, the deployment files - so the criteria you propose name the project's real commands and files, not guesses. You have only "read" and "list": this is a survey, not the work itself. Do not attempt the objective.

Then end the run by calling "success" with a summary in exactly this shape:

title: <title>
success:
- <criterion>
- <criterion>
rules_of_engagement:
- <constraint>

Rules:
- The title is a short label for a person scanning a list of objectives - a handful of words naming the engagement, not a restatement of the objective and not a sentence.
- One item per line after "- ". Each line is read verbatim - quote commands and filenames freely, no escaping is needed.
- Each success criterion must be observable: checkable by running a command, reading the working tree, or reading the run's own outcome (a finding, a report, a mapped surface), never a judgement of taste.
- Give 3 to 6 success criteria.
- List only rules of engagement that genuinely bound the work; an empty list is fine.`
